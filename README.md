# gore
Access UK renewable data using Go

## Background
This is based on my [pywind](https://github.com/zathras777/pywind) library but doesn't yet offer the same functionality.
Presently it is very verbose and some of the exporting isn't ideal.

## Usage

Presently there isn't much to see :-)

```
$ go build
$ ./gore
```

## Issues

- need to add ability to set dropdown values
- add elexon api options from [pywind](https://github.com/zathras777/pywind)
- improve the export formatting
- add a full command line app
- reduce the verbosity and improve the logging

## Pull Requests

I'm still new to publishing go packages, so feel free to contact me with suggestions and improvements. :-)

All help welcome.
